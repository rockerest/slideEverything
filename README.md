About
=====
I got tired of sliders that did one thing, and locked users into that one thing.  
I wanted a slider that would do everything, and give the user the power to control how it works.  

Roadmap
=======
1.  Directional Sliding  
   *  -right  
   *  -down  
   *  -up  
2.  UI for manual control
